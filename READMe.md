# Computer Science NEA Project

A repo dedicated to the NEA project. A place to collect together code from the project, along with other important files. 
- Please annotate new code well.
- Record appropriate descriptions for updates.

## C++ 3D Library
- OpenGL is a often used 3D library, found [here.](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/)
- Another found [here.](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D) Needs __Visual Studio__, not Visual Studio Code

## Python GUI
Found [here.](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) Documentation found [here.](https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)





# Pivot

Sometimes you can't keep going forward the way you initally thought. This is one of those times. The project is switching to (almost) entirely C++ from now on. OpenGL with be used for modelling. Add links to resources used here so they aren't lost later. 

# Links

## OpenGL

# To Do 
- create classes for elements, atoms and molecules
- abstracted format to represent an instance of an atom and its bonds to other specific atoms
- model molecule in 2D from atom information
- interact with molecule in 2D (add/remove atoms, change bonds)
- create GUI for program
- model molecule in 3D
- tokenize IUPAC name into needed data to model
- create class for functional groups and reactions
- create database of reaction routes and accessible molecules
- create AI that finds all possible routes from accessible molecules to designed molecule

## Mechanisms
- OCR A-Level mechanisms, found [here.](https://www.chemistrystudent.com/Revisionsheets/OCRMechanisms.pdf)
- Grinard mechanism, found [here.](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2015/12/10/reactions-of-grignard-reagents/)
- Diels-Alder cycloaddition, found [here.](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2017/08/30/the-diels-alder-reaction/) Research [Huckle's Rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel%27s_rule)
- Keto-enol tautomerism, found [here.](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2022/06/21/keto-enol-tautomerism-key-points/)
